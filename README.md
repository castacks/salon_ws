# salon_ws
Open Source Implementation of [SALON](https://theairlab.org/SALON)

Documentation coming soon, but this repo is set up as a ROS1 workspace. The launch files in src/context_adaptation will run the code necessary to reproduce the examples on different robots, specifically:
- online_hdif.launch
- online_hdif_wheelchair.launch
- online_hdif_anymal.launch
